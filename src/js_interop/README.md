# WebAssembly Playground

Hakana includes a WebAssembly-powered playground that runs entirely in the browser. You can try it online at https://hakana.dev or build it locally.

### Online Playground

The playground is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages whenever changes are made to the repo. 

### Building the Playground Locally

To build and serve the WebAssembly playground locally:

```bash
npm run start
```

The playground will be available at `http://localhost:8080`
